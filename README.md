# NETLAB HPC

This repsitory is a guide to start using the HPC of NetLab. Please
read carefully before using the cluster. Feel free to reach out to 
the system administrator, Ali SÃ¶nmez, whenever you need assistance.

## Access

To access the HPC server, you must be either on eduroam or the CMPE 
network. For remote access, follow the documentation of the university's
[VPN service](https://bilgiislem.bogazici.edu.tr/tr/ogrenciler-icin-vpn-hizmeti).
You will be able to access the server using `ssh` after establishing a connection
to the VPN service.

```bash
ssh name-surname@79.123.176.180
```

You will be asked for a password. This is the password you are provided with.
For convenience you can import your ssh key to the server via `ssh-import-id`.
Thus, you will be able to login without a password if one of your SSH keys on
your computer matches with the one on the server.
